# Thyroid Detection
According to recent statistics, approximately 4 in 10 adults in the world are suffering from thyroid
disease.
The small butterfly-shaped Thyroid gland controls the metabolism of our body which is present at the front part of our neck under our skin. The thyroid gland mainly produces two hormones T3 (Triiodothyronine), and T4 (Thyroxine).
I have designed this machine learning model to help the victims of thyroid suffering from its chronic effects.
Our machine learning model will use various classification algorithms like KNN(K-nearest neighbours) classifiers, random forest classifiers, Naive Bayes classifiers, random forest classifiers, SVM(support vector machines) and decision trees. Among all the above classification algorithms random forest has produced more accurate results.
Using explainable AI (XAI) to explain the results and output produced the best output.
The main advantage of the SHAP library is that it will help the user to understand which feature is most influential in the model.
In the above code folder, there are 2 jupyter notebook python files, those two contain different machine learning models with accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.
From all the models I have observed the Random Forest algorithm gives the best output.
The SHAP library of explainable AI explains the result from the algorithm in the best visual form.
I named the model as XRF.
